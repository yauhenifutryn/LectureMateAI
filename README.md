# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js

2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

## 🛠 Recommended Usage

To get the best results ("Master Tutor" quality), please follow these recording guidelines.

### 1. Audio Source & Quality
* **External Recording (Best Quality):** We highly recommend recording lectures using dedicated software like **OBS Studio** or **QuickTime**.
    * **Format:** Export as **MP3** or **M4A** for faster uploads.
    * **Workflow:** Record locally -> Drag & Drop the file into the "Lecture Audio" tab.
* **Microphone Recording:** Best for in-person seminars. Ensure you are close to the speaker or have a clear line of audio.

### 2. System Audio (Browser Recording)
If you need to record a live Zoom/Teams meeting directly from the browser:
* **Browser Requirement:** You must use **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge** on a **Desktop Computer** (Windows/Mac).
* **Mobile Limitation:** System audio capture is **not supported** on iPhone/iPad or Android due to OS security restrictions.
* **Virtual Audio:** If capturing specific desktop apps (like the Zoom Desktop App), ensure your system output is routed correctly (e.g., using a Virtual Audio Driver) before selecting the microphone input in the app.
